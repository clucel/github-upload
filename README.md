ran a couple PPI tests in the last few days of my rotation;
2 Syt3's (Cage9) and 4 Syt7's (Cages 6+7)

note: piezo was hanging off when I took Cage_Ln out, but the data looks fine
so I think it just got peeled off while I was removing the box

used IO_PPI_Combined.m (Dennis/Behavior/PPI Suite/Protocols)
IO habituation time set to 0s
cage identification in Chloe/Colony/Cage_IDs.csv

IO_plot.m = recreates the input-output plot that's made by the IO protocol

analysis.xlsx = plots the IO curves, habituation, and PPI for each genotype;
notes inside the sheet explain analysis; used Dennis's analysis for reference
(see Dennis/Behavior/PPI Suite/210820_IO_PPI_means_DW_65+105dB.xlsx)

analysis_combinedDW.xlsx = combined analysis of my+Dennis's data
